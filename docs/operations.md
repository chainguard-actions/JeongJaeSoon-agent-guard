# Operations

## Managed Claude Code rollout

Merge the Agent Guard keys into existing organization JSON, rather than replacing
unrelated settings. Use `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
on macOS and `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux/WSL.

Start from [`deployment/claude-managed-settings.example.json`](../deployment/claude-managed-settings.example.json).
It pins the marketplace source to a release tag, force-enables the plugin,
restricts marketplace sources, and disables automatic refreshes. Pin a reviewed
release tag; marketplace `ref` accepts a branch or tag, not a commit SHA. The
release workflow updates the canonical JSON example linked above. Merge that
file from the release you reviewed, then add the pilot's environment settings.
Change the tag only through an intentional, reviewed rollout.

The example intentionally has no `env` block. The product defaults are
`AGENT_GUARD_INFRA_FAILURE_MODE=open` and `AGENT_GUARD_PII_HOOK_MODE=off`. The
metadata log is introduced after v3.3.0 and is default-on only in releases that
contain it. For a rollout that prioritizes secret protection, use
`AGENT_GUARD_INFRA_FAILURE_MODE=closed`, as in the [pilot procedure](pilot.md).
PII is opt-in; do not force an
endpoint-backed provider without a separate privacy review. Set
`AGENT_GUARD_LOG_MODE=off` only in a release that contains the log and where
the metadata-only local support log is not permitted.

After policy delivery, each developer runs the host setup skill, approves any
dependency installation, restarts the host/session when asked, and completes
the live probes in [Verification](verification.md). Repeat this acceptance path
after every version or policy update.

In Claude Code, the user-facing sequence is:

```text
/agent-guard:setup-agent-guard
/agent-guard:setup-shell
/agent-guard:verify
```

The first skill resolves the installed plugin-local binary, so it remains
correct when a different standalone version is present on `PATH`. The last
command is a working-tree scan; it does not prove hook dispatch. Complete both
live probes after it.

For Codex, hooks are reviewed by their exact current definition. A changed hook
must be reviewed/trusted again before it runs. See official [Codex Hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Meaning and next action |
| --- | --- |
| `DEGRADED` | A dependency or policy could not be verified. Run `doctor`, then setup; it is not a clean scan. |
| `setup ok (dependencies only)` | Local dependencies are available. Run the live route probes. |
| Probe prints its raw marker | The tested route did not dispatch the expected hook. Check trust, restart, and retain Git/CI backstops. |
| A benign command is blocked as a protected path | The shell matcher saw path-shaped text. Use a clearly non-path-shaped expression after reviewing the command. |
| Post-write scan is unavailable | Treat it as infrastructure failure under the configured policy; do not claim the file was clean. |

## Claude shell integration

Plugin installs deliberately do not put `agent-guard` on `PATH`. In Claude Code,
run `/agent-guard:setup-shell`; it resolves the plugin-local executable and
requests approval before changing the shell rc. If the host cannot approve that
write, run the exact plugin-local command shown by the skill in a terminal. Do
not substitute an unrelated standalone binary on `PATH`.

```sh
agent-guard setup-shell
agent-guard setup-shell --no-command-wrapping
```

Restart the shell and every Claude Code session launched from it. The default
installs command wrapping; `--no-command-wrapping` is the persistent opt-out and
`AGENT_GUARD_COMMAND_WRAPPING=off` is a runtime opt-out. The integration is
text-only and does not make interactive shell escapes a complete security
boundary.

### fish

`shell-init` emits POSIX shell code, so fish cannot evaluate it. A standalone
install can use `agent-guard exec -- <command>` directly. For a plugin-only
installation, use the stable plugin-cache resolver path printed by
`/agent-guard:setup-shell`; its normal shape is
`$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/agent-guard/agent-guard/current/bin/agent-guard`.

```fish
function agx
    if type -q agent-guard
        command agent-guard exec -- $argv
        return $status
    end

    set -l _ag "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/agent-guard/agent-guard/current/bin/agent-guard"
    if not test -x "$_ag"
        printf 'agent-guard: plugin binary not found; rerun /agent-guard:setup-shell and use the fish executable path it prints\n' >&2
        return 127
    end
    command "$_ag" exec -- $argv
end
funcsave agx
```

The `current/bin/agent-guard` path is refreshed by plugin execution. If the
plugin cache is elsewhere, use the executable path printed by setup instead.

## Support evidence

Do not attach transcripts, raw stderr, `.env` files, private keys, or full hook
payloads. Include only the host, OS/architecture, Agent Guard version, command
or event category, outcome, and a manually sanitized error summary.

The metadata log is introduced after v3.3.0. When available,
`agent-guard logs export` provides a metadata-only JSONL report.
It excludes content, paths, environment variables, session IDs, and arbitrary
tool names. [Support](../SUPPORT.md) has the current submission checklist.
