# Integrations and coverage

Agent Guard keeps policy and scanning in its portable CLI. Host adapters pass
their native event to that CLI; they do not implement a second policy engine.
Use more than one layer for important repositories.

Per-tool matchers, the different output-replacement contracts of Claude and
Codex, and the timeout budgets are summarized in
[Output masking coverage](#output-masking-coverage). A matcher in this
repository does not prove that your installed copy dispatches it or that the
host accepts the replacement; run the live probes in
[Verification](verification.md).

## Claude Code

The plugin hooks inspect supported reads, writes, shell commands, web/MCP input,
and tool output. `PostToolUse` and `Stop` scan working-tree additions and
untracked files; a named write target also receives a direct post-write scan.
`UserPromptSubmit` scans prompts before they enter the model transcript.

The optional shell integration protects common `!` command-output cases by
running them through `agent-guard exec`. It needs an explicit shell-rc update.
It is a convenience layer, not a complete command interceptor; use normal host
tools, `agx`, Git hooks, or CI for a stronger backstop.

## Codex

The Codex plugin matches `Bash`, `apply_patch`, `Agent`, `Task`, and MCP tools.
It scans proposed patch additions before `apply_patch`, then scans changed files
after mutation and at stop. A patch envelope does not reliably identify a write
target, so it does not receive the direct named-file scan used by structured
write tools.

Codex does not promise interception of arbitrary `Read`, `Grep`, or web tools.
Its hooks also run only after their current definitions have been reviewed and
trusted. Official documentation covers plugin-hook trust and `PLUGIN_ROOT`:
[Codex Hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks). Test the exact tool route;
an orchestration wrapper can bypass the route a probe tested.

## Native Git hook

Install the supplied pre-commit hook from a standalone installation or a clone:

```sh
cd <your-project>
~/.agent-guard/install.sh git-hooks

# From an Agent Guard source checkout instead:
/absolute/path/to/agent-guard/install.sh git-hooks
```

The installer sets `core.hooksPath=githooks` only when it will not overwrite an
existing hook setup. It scans staged added lines. Check the result with:

```sh
git config --get core.hooksPath
test -x githooks/pre-commit
```

The expected hooks path is `githooks`. A hook can be bypassed by someone who
can alter local Git configuration, so it complements rather than replaces CI.

## GitHub Actions

Use the Action on pull requests and pushes to scan a checkout in CI. It is the
repository backstop for paths and host routes that an interactive plugin does
not observe.

```yaml
name: Agent Guard

on:
  pull_request:
  push:

jobs:
  secret-guard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
      - uses: JeongJaeSoon/agent-guard@v3
        with:
          paths: "."
          gitleaks-version: "8.30.1"
          gitleaks-checksum: "551f6fc83ea457d62a0d98237cbad105af8d557003051f41f3e7ca7b3f2470eb"
```

`@v3` is a moving major-version tag and receives compatible updates. For a
managed rollout, replace it with the exact reviewed release tag, such as
`@v3.4.1`, and advance that pin through a reviewed pull request. A commit SHA
provides an even tighter immutable pin when your organization requires it.

The shown checksum is for gitleaks 8.30.1 on `linux/x64`; refresh the version
and checksum together when changing either one. Generate a matching value with
`agent-guard checksum`. `require-checksum` is `true` by default. Set it to
`false` only for local experimentation. `paths` is whitespace separated, so an
individual path cannot contain spaces.

## Limits and backstops

- Working-tree scans cover tracked additions and non-ignored untracked files.
  They do not sweep ignored files or arbitrary content outside the repository.
- A structured write target is scanned even when it is ignored or outside the
  work tree. Codex `apply_patch` paths are also directly scanned when the patch
  names them. The tracked diff, index diff, and untracked-content components
  each receive one third of the 10 MiB working-tree input budget, keeping their
  total below 10 MiB. Files requiring a direct scan have a separate 10 MiB
  aggregate budget; files covered by a successful working-tree backstop do not
  consume it. These are bounded-input policies, not measured wall-clock timeouts.
  An oversized or unreadable target is an infrastructure failure, not a clean
  scan. The 10 MiB default can only be raised, with
  `AGENT_GUARD_SCAN_INPUT_MAX_BYTES` (see [configuration](configuration.md));
  both budgets derive from it.
- Bash and MCP mutations may lack a usable named target. Their working-tree
  backstop remains useful but cannot discover every ignored or
  outside-repository write.
- When one mutation produces both a working-tree finding and sensitive tool
  output, the PostToolUse hook reserves its single stdout JSON value for the
  host-valid sanitized output. It reports the disk finding on stderr and marks
  the audit outcome `blocked`. A disk finding with no output rewrite still exits
  with status 2.
- Shell blocking is pattern-based. It can block benign path-shaped text and an
  actively evasive command can avoid a fixed pattern list.
- A user-typed host shell escape is outside the tool-hook boundary. Do not print
  credentials there; use `agent-guard exec -- <command>` / `agx`, redirect both
  streams away from the transcript, or run the command through a protected host
  tool.

These are coverage boundaries, not proof that every failure mode is permissive.
Scanner infrastructure follows the explicit `AGENT_GUARD_INFRA_FAILURE_MODE`
policy described in [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Output masking coverage

Output masking rewrites a tool result before the model reads it. It runs only
on the routes below, only when the host dispatches the hook and accepts the
replacement, and `AGENT_GUARD_OUTPUT_REDACT=off` turns it off. A route listed
as covered is a candidate: prove it on your install with the live probes in
[Verification](verification.md).

| Host | Route | Masking | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | Successful `PostToolUse` of `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`, `Bash`, `PowerShell`, `apply_patch`, `Read`, `NotebookRead`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Agent`, `Task`, `Skill`, `Monitor`, `LSP`, `ListMcpResourcesTool`, `ReadMcpResourceTool` | Covered | The matcher is anchored to these exact names. |
| Claude | `mcp__*` tools | Covered | MCP results skip the built-in output schema check. |
| Claude | Failed tool calls (`PostToolUseFailure`) | Not covered | Separate event; not in the manifest. |
| Claude | Any other tool name | Not covered | The hook never starts. |
| Claude | A `!` shell escape you type yourself | Not covered | Outside the tool-hook boundary; use `agent-guard exec` / `agx`. |
| Claude | Image or PDF blocks | Text parts only | Binary bytes are restored unchanged; if that restore fails the payload is emptied rather than leaked. |
| Claude | Sessions with function hooks (Claude Mods) enabled | Covered | Command hooks keep running as `classic.*` events. Probed on 2.1.278. Other mods' own file and network access is not seen. |
| Codex | `Bash` / `exec_command`, `apply_patch`, `Agent`, `Task`, `mcp__*` | Covered | Codex replaces the result with hook feedback (`decision: "block"` plus `additionalContext`), not with `updatedToolOutput`. |
| Codex | `write_stdin` | No new event | The original command's `PostToolUse` may arrive when it ends. |
| Codex | Other local tools, hosted `WebSearch` | Not covered | Not a coverage claim. The Codex matcher is unanchored, so a custom tool whose name merely contains `Bash`, `Agent`, or `Task` (for example `MyTaskRunner`) may still trigger generic redaction; that incidental match is not treated as coverage. Hosted `WebSearch` is not on the hook path at all. |

What masking cannot do on either host:

- Undo the tool effect. Files, commands, and network requests already happened
  when `PostToolUse` runs; masking is a model-input boundary, not a rollback.
- Survive a timeout. A hook killed at the host budget produces no replacement,
  and a timed-out Claude `PreToolUse` does not block the call. Keep the Git
  hook and CI backstops.
- Force acceptance. If a Claude built-in replacement does not match the tool's
  output schema, the host may keep the original. Agent Guard preserves the
  original JSON shape whenever it can; the last-resort fixed `[REDACTED]` string
  is the known exception.

Hook timeouts in every shipped manifest:

| Event | Timeout |
| --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse` | 10 s |
| `PostToolUse` | 20 s |
| `Stop` | 20 s |
| `SessionStart` | 5 s |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | 10 s |

`AGENT_GUARD_INFRA_FAILURE_MODE=closed` applies when Agent Guard itself can
decide and return exit status 2 in time. A non-empty payload that is not a JSON
object is rejected regardless of that mode; empty stdin passes with status 0.
