# Agent Guard

Agent Guard is a local-first guardrail for Claude Code, Codex, Git hooks,
GitHub Actions, and direct shell use. It blocks common secret-exposure paths
before a supported tool runs, redacts supported tool output, and scans changed
files after mutations. It uses `gitleaks` and portable shell; it has no hosted
account, telemetry collector, or developer service.

It is a defense-in-depth boundary. Keep GitHub Secret Scanning, Push
Protection, review, and normal credential management in place. Agent Guard is
not a vault, DLP system, EDR, or credential rotator.

## Choose your path

| I need to… | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Install a Claude Code or Codex plugin, CLI, Git hook, or Action | [Installation](docs/installation.md) |
| Understand host coverage and configure an integration | [Integrations](docs/integrations.md) |
| Verify a setup and understand what the result proves | [Verification](docs/verification.md) |
| Configure policy, PII, redaction, or infrastructure behavior | [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) |
| Deploy for a managed team or troubleshoot an environment | [Operations](docs/operations.md); the [Korean/Japanese deployment guide](https://agent-guard-guide.jaesoon.chatgpt.site/) is a supplementary, currently published walkthrough |

## Quick use

After installing a plugin, run its guided setup:

```text
# Claude Code
/agent-guard:setup-agent-guard

# Codex
$setup-agent-guard
```

The setup flow checks local dependencies and runs synthetic checks. It does not
prove that your current host tool route dispatches hooks; complete the harmless
live probes in [Verification](docs/verification.md) before relying on a plugin
boundary.

For a direct repository check:

```sh
agent-guard scan-working-tree
agent-guard scan-staged
agent-guard scan-path .
```

## Support log

Save the metadata-only local support log with one command:

```sh
agent-guard logs export --output agent-guard-support.jsonl
```

The parent directory must already exist. Agent Guard creates a new mode-0600
file and refuses to replace an existing file or symlink. Use the plugin-local
executable printed by the setup skill when a plugin-only installation does not
provide `agent-guard` on `PATH`. See [Support](SUPPORT.md) for what to submit.

## Requirements and scope

Supported platforms are macOS and Linux on x64 and arm64. Runtime dependencies
are `sh`, `awk`, `git`, `jq`, and gitleaks 8.30 or newer. Windows is not
currently supported.

Default processing is local and ephemeral. Read [Privacy](PRIVACY.md) before
